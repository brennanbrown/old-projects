# The `while` and `until` Constructs

## Objectives

1. Build a method that uses `while`
2. Build a method that uses `until`


# Using `while` and `until`

It's our first year at Hogwarts and we're struggling to master the levitation charm, "Wingardium Leviosa". Currently, we have a levitation force of `6`. We need to have a levitation force of `10` in order to actually levitate that feather.

First, we'll write a while loop that will continue to `puts` the phrase "Wingardium Leviosa" while our levitation force is less than `10`. Everytime we `puts` that phrase, we should increment our levitation force by `1`.


Then, we'll solve this again by using an `until` loop. It will `puts` the phrase "Wingardium Leviosa" until the levitation force is equal to `10`, incrementing the levitation force by `1` each time we `puts` the phrase.

## Instructions

1. Run the test suite in this lab to get started.

3. Let's get the first test passing by coding our solution in `while.rb`:
Fill out the content of the `using_while` method so that calling it will `puts` the desired phrase while your levitation force is less than `10`. Remember, every time you `puts` the phrase, you should increment your levitation force by `1`.

4. Let's get the second test passing by coding our solution in `until.rb`:
Fill out the content of the `using_until` method to `puts` the desired phrase, "Wingardium Leviosa", until our levitation force equals `10`. Remember, every time you `puts` the phrase, you should increment your levitation force by `1`.

**Hint: If you get stuck an infinite loop when you run your tests or your code, you can abort the test run or code by pressing `CONTROL+C` on your keyboard.**
